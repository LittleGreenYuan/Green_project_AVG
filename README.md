# Green project: C-based JRPG using AVG

Green project is an original AVG game made by C that contains JRPG elements.

Green project is about a series of stories of a group called 'Green' in a parallel universe. These stories take place on Earth in different settings, some in virtual worlds, some in episodic worlds and some in game worlds. In these arenas, together they interpret the changes of Greens.

## Introduction
In this work, I used C to implement the general requirements of an AVG game, including dialogue performance, plot selection, archiving and reading. And on top of that, I added JRPG elements to implement turn-based battles between player and computer, including common elements such as character selection, skills, energy and life, Debuffs and buffs, and ultimate skills.

## Production Environment
C

## Attention
This game is based on a console implementation of C, where the interface and the visualization of the choices are implemented on this basis.

The demo shown includes the game body, the required txt data file, the audio (due to the large file size, the audio needs to be replaced by the same name and format), and the description of the structure.

It is worth noting that the game is written in Chinese.

Since the txt data file is publicly available, the demo can be used as a performance for other episodes. If you use or learn from the project, please indicate the address and author of this project
